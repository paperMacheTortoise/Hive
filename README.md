## Commit msgs: start with () and close waffle issue accordingly
(feat) (fix) (refactor) (cleanup) (test) (doc)

## branching, commit, pull-request checklist
1. Create a new branch: 'git checkout -b 'doc/readme "
2. Review the waffle issues before making your commit: https://waffle.io/paperMacheTortoise/bizGram
